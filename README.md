Fun Side project to fine tune a gpt model to respond to prompts in the voice of Eric Cartman. No clue how far I will get with this. I guess we'll see.

Update: I took a lot of inspiration from this very informative tutorial on generating a bot that was capable of discourse. https://towardsdatascience.com/make-your-own-rick-sanchez-bot-with-transformers-and-dialogpt-fine-tuning-f85e6d1f4e30
Although, I did change up a few things here and there. On my dataset, it took around 2.5 hours to train on Google Colab.

The code itself lives in the ipynb checkpoint folder for some reason. You can generate the dataset by running the ScriptEx.py file. While the training procedure is rather verbose, it is actually quite simple if you stare at it long enough. 

PSA: Eric Cartman is a horrible child, and a Chatbot made to immitate him is also bound to be incredibly rude. Proceed at your own caution.
